Description: Manages a pool of VMs making sure they are available for quick use
        
        This package is useful when users want to test against pristine VMs. VMs
        are acquired, modified during testing then when finished are released back
        to testpool. Where they are reclaimed, destroyed and cloned from a specified
        template.
        
        The goal is for VMs to always be available when tests need them and not 
        waiting for VMs to be cloned.
