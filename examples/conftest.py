""" Populate test database with an example.

Check to see if the user has created an example test profile, if not
create a fake example profile. A fake example profile uses an in memory
pretent hypervisor. This is sufficient for seeing the Testpool client
API in action and for debugging. However following the Quickstart
guide in Testpool shows how to provide an example profile for a KVM
hypervisor.

This code would normally not be required. Refer to the quick start guide or
installation instruction for setting up a KVM hypervisor.
